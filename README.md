# chrome jira extensions

things to make the atlassian jira experience (a bit) nicer

## install instructions

- go to chrome://extensions/
- turn on “Developer Mode” in the upper right
- click “Load Unpacked” in the upper left
- select the folder for the plugin and press “Select Folder”
- then it should work!!

## hide version labels

hides the version labels from the backlog. I find these add limited information during planning, and obscure part of the title, especially when viewing a story in a side panel.

much better! you can read things with a slightly smaller backlog window/bigger story section!

you can click the icon to toggle the behaviour (change only takes effect upon refreshing page)
